Hi!

My name is Lucas Fran√ßozo. I love computing, hardware, automation and video games. 

I want to learn programming since I was a teenager. 

My objective with programming is to create games, to develop software solutions and Arduino or simililar automation or electromechanical applications.

In this moment I'm learning Python language and I'm enjoying it a lot. 

I also want to study: Basic, C++ and Assembly computer languages (with emphasis on 8088), Objective-C for Mac Os, Java for mobile 
and specific video games assembly languages as MIPS R4K for Nintendo 64 and 6502 Assembly for Mega Drive and Objective-C for Dreamcast and Playstation.

Most programs I post here may be in Portuguese because it's my native language and I like to use it on the programs I write but I'll try to post English versions of them too.
